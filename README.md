## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other code editor of your choice)

## Getting Started in VS Code

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Open the Project in VS Code

If you haven't already, open the project folder in VS Code.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, you need to install all the project's dependencies listed in `package.json`. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl` + `\``) and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the necessary libraries into the `node_modules` folder.

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server. The project uses Next.js with Turbopack for faster development. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode.

### 4. View the Application

After the server starts, you will see output in the terminal indicating that the app is ready. It will typically look like this:

```
   â–² Next.js 15.3.3 (Turbopack)
   - Local:        http://localhost:9002
   - Network:      http://0.0.0.0:9002
```

You can now open your web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:9002** to see your application running live. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the page.
